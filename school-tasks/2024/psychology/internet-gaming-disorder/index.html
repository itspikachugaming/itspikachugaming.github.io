    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 69x;">Internet Gaming Disorder</h1>
    <br>
    <h1>More information in detail:</h1>
    <h2>1. From Professor Daniel King, Flinders University in the BTN video. As he said, this mental disorder is categorised under the addiction disorder. "When someone feels a recurring urge to do or use something even though it might be harmful consequences." - From powerpoint, 4. Categories of Mental Discorders.</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>2. From Lee Anne Phie's real life perspective in the BTN video. Since they don't go to school as much as they should, they loose education that would effect their future</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>3. Dr Kim Le said he witnessed this before in the BTN video. This would be short term since it won't effect their future if its just a one off but if it is multiple times this might be long term since</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>4. Being a male can increase your chances of having a gaming disorder since males can get a higher chance of aggressive behaviours. Compared to females, after a while of being addicted to gaming, male brains had a altercation superior frontal gyrus which is used for impulse control meanwhile females brains never had any changes compared to those who don’t play games at all. In a study case, 66.4% of the people were male. During the pandemic, people like Lee Ann, found that talking to their own friends were a challenge since they didn’t have access to social media to talk to each other. Therefore more teenagers would have more chances of gaming disorders.</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>5. From the BTN video. People start developing this gaming disorder by not getting enough sleep at night, this would make the person not able to wake up in the morning for school. After a month of being addicted to gaming, they start to over-proritise gaming over even eating and drinking. After a year, if the person is still having trouble stopping when they should, they would classified as having a gaming disorder. See Picture 1. Everyone can game once and a while and gives enjoyment out of it, this is at the healthy gaming stage. When people start to spend too much time on gaming and some risks come, this is in the hazardous gaming stage. Following that, the gaming addiction is estimated only 1% of the population that has those addiction criteria, according to Professor Daniel King. (this spectrum is just liek the mental health continuum)</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>6. From the BTN video. The average age that has this disorder is around early adulthood. This is becuase this is the age where people go from teenagers to adults, they would have less restrictions, etc. </h2>
    <br>
    <h2>7. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a way to reduce people’s addiction to gaming, as Lee Anne said, spending more time with your friends in person is a great way, make some plans with them. Professor Danial King also suggested that taking a break even just for a weekend will help you find something else you could do with your time, finding what you had missed by playing games, create some real goals in life and find a way to complete those. Also mentioned in the BTN video, it is not just the gamers that need to take control of their habits, the government also needs to put in e-safety rules to protect those who don’t know what the addiction is really about like those aged 12 or younger. <b style="color: aqua;">Note that if it is a young child that you feel is addicted, do not just take their devices away, they will have lots of anger and other type of emotions. Try talking to them about a plan you that you both agree on.</b></h2>
